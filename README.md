# Simple-Encrytion-Decryption-CLI-Program
#### A simple encrytion-decrytion program developed using C++

* This is a simple CLI-based encrytion-decryption program developed using C++
* The "epd2.cpp" is the final file which can create, add data to, encrypt/decrypt its data, and read data from the file
* The "Encryption and Decrytion.cpp" file creates unique and different files for encrypted and decrypted data (more work needed on it)
* The program was created using Code:Blocks IDE. 
* People using Visual Studio **please include "conio.h" header file and add "_getch()" function after every block finish** to prevent application from closing immediately.
* People using Turbo C++ **please include "conio.h" header file and add "getch()" function after every block finish** to prevent application from closing immediately
* Suggestions to make this application work better are always appreciated!
